JYToolBox
=========

	JYToolBox is a light tool library for iOS development, I write this for those who wants to control his project absolutely, I mean, 100% full pure code, never take a big holy library if we have another choice, just like me :)
	You don't need to install the JYToolBox, just take a glance the wiki page, and choose which class you need, also you can change it as you want, there is no relation between them. The majority of code is written by myself, and others were takken from blog, forum, open-source project.
